## JavaScript XML Developer

Hey there! I am *Martin Middel*. I am an experienced JavaScript developer who is currently working
with [Fonto](fontoxml.com), the best XML editor in the world!

I regularly represent Fonto at XML conferences: [here in
2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fRoqUG7o70), [here in
2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwjQ3yqPyM) and here in
[2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoeADE-9MIg).

I am deeply involved in the development of [FontoXPath](https://github.com/fontoxml/fontoxpath], the
best free open source XPath 3.1 implementation that runs in the browser! [Contact
me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmiddel/) if you'd like me to help you out with developing with
JavaScript and XML, or FontoXPath specifically!
